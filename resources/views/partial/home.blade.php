                    Hello there, I'm Leniel. I'm a software developer and designer,
                    and I love to mix these disciplines to create apps and to bring awsome ideas to life!
                    If you're a curious person, take a look around to my projects and posts.
                    Make sure to have fun, and get in contact with me to create something espectacular,
                    ¡wish you a good day!
